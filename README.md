# Trello-Cli
I have created a CLI program to Create and update the trello cards.

User Instructions:
1. Please run the Python file in the program.
2. If you select to create a card, the program will display the lists that you can create the card in. 
3. Give the user inputs prompted in the command line. This will create the card for you on the Trello board in the specified list.
4. If you select the option to update an already existing card, the program will display the list of cards you can update.
5. Follow step 3 to update the card.

Further Updates:
This is a very baseline program. The further steps can be:
1. The program can be divided into multiple files, so that if we want to add more functionalities, it remains in different files and is modular.
2. Although the code handle the different input types, we can still add checks on inputs like Date, if the ID's given as input are correct.
